COMPETITION EXPERIENCE
================================================================================

1. Image Processing and Motion Control
   During the competition, to achieve the goal of vehicle debugging and control, 
   I was responsible for writing the code for image processing and motion control 
   algorithms in the Python software development environment. I utilized sensors 
   such as cameras and single-line LiDAR to complete the low-level steering of 
   the servo and the movement control of the motor.

2. Common Bug Fixing
   Bugs frequently occurred in the software. I was familiar with disassembling 
   the entire system, conducting breakpoint testing, and other methods to correct 
   and optimize severe bugs, ultimately ensuring the smooth and efficient 
   operation of the software system.

3. Technical Document Compilation
   According to the competition requirements, I summarized, analyzed, and 
   archived the team's technologies, and compiled technical files.

4. Team Organization, Planning, and Communication Skills
   To rationally plan team goals and share team information, I completed the 
   efficient operation of the organization and maintained a harmonious team 
   atmosphere by pre-planning task goals and communicating with team members.

INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE
================================================================================

Hangzhou Huidian Information Co., Ltd. | Back-end Developer (Python Direction)
Jun 2024 - Sep 2024

1. Developed a document processing system based on deep learning and seal 
   recognition: Utilized PyTorch and paddlepaddle OCR for seal recognition, 
   and integrated Tesseract OCR to build a text recognition pipeline.

2. Designed a contract comparison engine: Employed OpenCV template matching 
   and text similarity algorithm (Cosine Similarity) to automatically mark 
   differences in contract terms.

3. Setup a team shared development environment (Docker + GitLab), encapsulated 
   Python programs using Docker, and collaborated with Java back-end developers 
   for data transmission. Managed versions using Markdown + Git.

Hangzhou Wonder-Light Smart Energy Co., Ltd. | Python Development Intern
Jun 2025 - Sep 2025

• Engineered an intelligent obscuration detection system for solar panels 
  utilizing Python and OpenCV for image preprocessing and augmentation.

• Trained and fine-tuned custom deep learning models using YOLO for object 
  detection and U-Net (or similar) for semantic segmentation to accurately 
  identify and locate obstructions like bird droppings, dust, and leaves.

• Developed an image processing module to perform pixel-level analysis on 
  detected regions, precisely calculating the percentage of obscuration area 
  to assess impact on power generation efficiency.

• Improved the model's mean Average Precision (mAP) on the test set by 
  optimizing hyperparameters and applying data augmentation techniques, 
  effectively supporting the O&M team's cleaning decisions.
